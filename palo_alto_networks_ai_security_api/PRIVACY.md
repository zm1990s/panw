## Privacy

The PANW AI Security plugin respects user privacy and handles data with care. Here's what you need to know about data collection and usage:

### Data Collection

    API Key: The only credential required is your PANW AI Security API key.
    Content to be Checked: The content you wish to do a security check via PANW AI Security.
    No Personal Data: We do not collect or store any personal user data.

### Data Usage

    The API key is used for authentication with the PANW AI Security solution.
    The content to be checked is used solely for the purpose of conducting a security check via PANW AI Security and is not stored or logged after the check is completed.
    All communication is conducted through PANW AI Security's official API endpoints.

### Data Storage

    No data is permanently stored by this plugin.
    Credentials are stored securely by the Dify platform.
    Check results are stored on PANW hosted Strata Logging Services, which are tenant isolated and private.
    

### Third-party Services

    This plugin only interacts with PANW AI Security's official API service.
    No other third-party services are used.

### Security

    All communication with PANW AI Security API is done via HTTPS.
    Error messages are sanitized to prevent sensitive information leakage.
